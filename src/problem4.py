Solution to Project Euler problem 4
https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

Problem Statement :
    
>>>>>>>>>>> 

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

>>>>>>>>>>>

Assumptions  / Limitations : 
    
1. The largest palindrome will be a product between the numbers 900 - 1000


Result : 
Expected Answer - 906609 = 913*993
